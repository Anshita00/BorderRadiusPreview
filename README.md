## Border radius previewer

Type the values of the 4 border radius properties (top-left, top-right, bottom-left and border-right) in pixels and see it reflected in real time on the red box below.

You can also click on the red box (or whatever beautiful shape you have made it into) and copy the resulting CSS to use in your web app.

The application is hosted here - https://zealous-neumann-0a5743.netlify.app/
